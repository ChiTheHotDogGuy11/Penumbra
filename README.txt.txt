OVERVIEW

	Included are the most current versions of the Spotify app and the mobile app. 
	Note that although the server scripts are included, you don't ever need to actually
	run them as they are included just so you could better understand my thought process.

SPOTIFY APP

	1. Create a file called "Spotify" in your home folder (or "My Documents" in Windows).
	2. Copy the "spotifyApp" folder in the zip I gave you to this folder.
	3. Open Spotify and type spotify:app:penumbra in the search bar. 
	4. Party hard.

MOBILE CLIENT

	NOTE: At this point, the mobile client only works for Android as I don't have the time or 
	iPhone to port it to the iPhone (yet).

	1. Download Eclipse if you don't already have it.
	2. Import the zip entitled "mobileClient" into Eclipse.
	3. Connect your Android via usb to your computer, and make sure Applications -> Development -> USB debugging
		 on your phone is enabled.
	4. Run the project (you may have to play around with Run -> Run Configurations 
		in Eclipse to have it default to your phone).
